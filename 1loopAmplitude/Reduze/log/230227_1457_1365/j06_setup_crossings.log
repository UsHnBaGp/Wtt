Setting up crossings for kinematics ''
Crossing equivalence: '' -> ''
External legs:
  external leg 1 is incoming, has momenta p1 and mass 0
  external leg 2 is incoming, has momenta p2 and mass 0
  external leg 3 is incoming, has momenta p3 and mass mt^2
  external leg 4 is incoming, has momenta p4 and mass mt^2
  external leg 5 is incoming, has momenta -p1-p3-p2-p4 and mass s23+s12+s34+s14-4*mt^2+s24+s13
Rules to replace scalar products by kinematic invariants:
  SP(p2,p4) -> -1/2*mt^2+1/2*s24
  SP(p1,p2) -> 1/2*s12
  SP(p2,p2) -> 0
  SP(p3,p3) -> mt^2
  SP(p1,p4) -> 1/2*s14-1/2*mt^2
  SP(p3,p2) -> 1/2*s23-1/2*mt^2
  SP(p4,p4) -> mt^2
  SP(p1,p1) -> 0
  SP(p3,p4) -> 1/2*s34-mt^2
  SP(p1,p3) -> -1/2*mt^2+1/2*s13
Permutations of external legs (before completing):
[]
[[1, 2]]
[[3, 4]]
Discarding invalid crossings due to numeric kinematic invariants:
discarded 0 crossings
Completing the permutations:
Permutations of external legs:
[]
[[1, 2]]
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
[[3, 4]]
Generating crossings:
  generated crossing [[1, 2]]
  generated crossing [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
  generated crossing [[3, 4]]
Number of crossings (identity included): 4
